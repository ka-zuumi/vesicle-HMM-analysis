HMM Vesicle Analysis
=========================

What biophysical simulations can be analyzed?
---------------------------------------------

This set of codes are primarily for simulations of vesicles (sphere-likelipid membranes)

Where to start?
---------------

- Prepare the simulation as either a .pdb file or .gro/.trr file
