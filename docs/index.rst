HMM Vesicle Analysis
=========================

What biophysical simulations can be analyzed?
---------------------------------------------

This set of codes are primarily for simulations of vesicles (sphere-like lipid membranes).

Where to start?
---------------

Prepare the simulation as either a .pdb file or .gro/.trr file

- :doc:`DataPreparation`

Download the code and required software

- :doc:`Installation`

Analyze the simulation
